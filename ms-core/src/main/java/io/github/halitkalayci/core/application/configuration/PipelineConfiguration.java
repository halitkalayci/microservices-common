/**
 * Configures the Pipelinr command and notification pipeline for the application.
 *
 * <p>
 * This configuration class sets up the Pipelinr pipeline, which is used for handling
 * commands and notifications within the application. It leverages Spring's dependency injection
 * to automatically discover and register all command handlers, notification handlers, and
 * middleware that are available in the application context.
 * </p>
 * The pipeline is configured to support command and notification processing, enabling a clean,
 * decoupled architecture that separates the concerns of command handling, notification handling,
 * and cross-cutting concerns handled by middleware.
 *
 * @see Command.Handler for how commands are handled within the pipeline.
 * @see Notification.Handler for how notifications are dispatched and handled.
 * @see Command.Middleware for how middleware can intercept and process commands and notifications.
